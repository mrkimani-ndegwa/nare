are currently doing and where. This will take the form of:
1. A Simple Web App - Typesrcipt + React + Emotion + Redux Saga/Obvservables
2. Python API Backend built using Flask and GraphQL
3. Kotlin Mobile app which will take the format of a screensaver application

The following steps will document the process of setting up the project and going through all the subsequent features to make this a reality.
Also, we are Open Source
